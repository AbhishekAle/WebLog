            Sagarmāthā National Park is a national park in the Himalayas of
            eastern Nepal that was established in 1976 and encompasses an area
            of 1,148 km2 (443 sq mi) in the Solukhumbu District. It ranges in
            elevation from 2,845 to 8,848 m (9,334 to 29,029 ft) and includes
            Mount Everest. In the north, it shares the international border with
            Qomolangma National Nature Preserve in Tibet Autonomous Region. In
            the east, it is adjacent to Makalu Barun National Park, and in the
            south it extends to Dudh Kosi river.[1] It is part of the Sacred
            Himalayan Landscape.[2] History Entrance gate of the Sagarmatha
            National Park Sagarmatha National Park was established on July 19,
            1976.[3] In 1979, it became the country's first national park that
            was inscribed as a Natural World Heritage Site. In January 2002, a
            Buffer Zone comprising 275 km2 (106 sq mi) was added.[1]
            Conservation of forests, wildlife, and cultural resources received
            top priority under the Buffer Zone Management Guidelines, followed
            by conservation of other natural resources and development of
            alternative energy.[4] Tourism in the area began in the early 1960s.
            In 2003, about 19,000 tourists arrived. As of 2005, about 3,500
            Sherpa people lived in villages and seasonal settlements situated
            along the main tourist trails.[5] Landscape Sagarmatha National Park
            contains the upper catchment areas of the Dudh Kosi and Bhotekoshi
            rivers and the Gokyo Lakes. It ranges in elevation from 2,845 m
            (9,334 ft) at Monjo to the top of Mount Everest at 8,848 m (29,029
            ft). Other peaks above 6,000 m (20,000 ft) are Lhotse, Cho Oyu,
            Thamserku, Nuptse, Amadablam and Pumori. Barren land above 5,000 m
            (16,000 ft) comprises 69% of the park while 28% is grazing land and
            the remaining 3% is forested. Climatic zones span from temperate and
            subalpine above 3,000 m (9,800 ft) to alpine above 4,000 m (13,000
            ft), which is the upper limit of vegetation growth. The nival zone
            begins at 5,000 m (16,000 ft).[1] Wildlife Flowers at an elevation
            of 5,000 m (16,000 ft) Flora The forests in the subalpine belt
            consist of fir, Himalayan birch and rhododendron. Juniper and
            rhododendron prevail at elevations of 4,000–5,000 m (13,000–16,000
            ft). Mosses and lichens grow above 5,000 m (16,000 ft).[6] More than
            1,000 floral species were recorded in the national park.[1] Fauna
            Snowcock in the national park Sagarmatha National Park hosts 208
            bird species including Impeyan pheasant, bearded vulture, snowcock
            and alpine chough.[1] It has been designated as an Important Bird
            Area.[7] Ungulates include Himalayan thar, Himalayan serow and musk
            deer. The snow leopard inhabits elevations above 3,500 m (11,500
            ft), and the Indian leopard roams forests in lower elevations.[8]
